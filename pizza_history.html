        Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
        flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese,
        and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
        which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
        A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

        In Italy, pizza is served informal settings, such as at a restaurant,
        is presented unsliced and eaten with a knife and fork.
        In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in hand.

    The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the
    Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. The modern pizza was invented in Naples,
    and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.
    It has become one of the most popular foods globally and a typical fast food item in Europe,
    North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza),
    restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and street food. In addition,
    various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, frozen in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven.
