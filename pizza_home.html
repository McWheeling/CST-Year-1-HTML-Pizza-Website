            In <strong>2001</strong>, Saskpolytech Pizza Store first opened its doors to Saskatoon with a vision -
            to build a business on a foundation of excellent cuisine, friendly service and affordable prices.

        <p>
            <em>More than 15 years later...</em> the vision has become a Saskpolytech Pizza Store tradition.
            As one of Saskatoon's oldest independent school-owned restaurants,
            Saskpolytech Pizza Store prides itself on treating students like family.
            From the warm atmosphere to the courteous service,
            our restaurant has become a "home away from home" for many regular customers.

        <blockquote>
            Perhaps the essential ingredient in Saskpolytech Pizza Store's success has been the pizza itself.
            Our homemade dough is handcrafted from a secret recipe handed down from generation to generation.
            Our tangy tomato sauce is made from only the freshest vegetables and spices.
            Add in top-quality meats and rich, tasty cheeses, and you have the perfect pizza.
